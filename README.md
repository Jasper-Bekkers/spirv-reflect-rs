Reflection API in rust for SPIR-V shader byte code, intended for Vulkan applications.

This crate provides an FFI layer and idiomatic rust wrappers for the excellent [SPIRV-Reflect](https://github.com/chaoticbob/SPIRV-Reflect) C/C++ library.

- [Release Notes](https://github.com/gwihlidal/spirv-reflect-rs/releases)

## About this fork

This is a fork that is kept up-to-date with upstream but with some minor changes to reduce it's impact on compilation times.

* The serde dependency is completely removed.
* The spirv_headers dependency is more up to date (which has removed / bumped some major dependencies).
* The `cc` dependency is compiled without the `parallel` feature as to not have to drag in `rayon` and other parallelization features. spirv-reflect only needs to compile a single C file so having this feature enabled doesn't make a lot of sense to begin with.

## Features

* Extract descriptor bindings from SPIR-V bytecode, to assist in the generation of Vulkan descriptor set and pipeline layouts.
* Extract push constant block size from SPIR-V bytecode to assist in the generation of pipeline layouts.
* Extract full layout data for uniform buffer and push constant blocks from SPIR-V bytecode, to assist in application updates of these structures.
* Extract input/output variables from SPIR-V bytecode (including semantic decorations for HLSL shaders), to assist in validation of pipeline input/output settings.
* Easily map Vulkan types to DirectX 12 resource types
* Remap descriptor bindings, and update the source SPIR-V bytecode accordingly.
* Log all reflection data as human-readable text.

## Planned Features

* Extensive unit tests and examples.
* Pure rust version.
* Command line tool for reflection and manipulation.

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
spirv-reflect = "0.2.1"
```

and add this to your crate root:

```rust
extern crate spirv_reflect;
```

## Example

Currently there is only a single monolithic `demo` example, which shows some usage. A CLI tool is planned that will be useful on its own, and as a clean example of usage patterns.

```shell
cargo run --release --example demo
```
